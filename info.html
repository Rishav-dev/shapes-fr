    <h1>An introduction to Neural Networks</h1>
    At first sight, a machine recognizing handrawn shapes may not seem very impressive. After all you can do it all the
    time with your own eyes. But if you think about it, it is actually quite a feat. The individual pixels being lit in
    these 2 images are very different.

    <h1>How Neural Networks work</h1>
    <p>To understand how neural networks work we'll use our simple model as an example. This will make it easier to
        understand but in reality theres so much more to neural networks and machine learning in general that we can't
        cover it all here.</p>

    <p>First we need to convert the image into something a computer can understand and process. Since we're using a
        black and white canvas we can use a single grayscale
        value for each pixel to make processing faster.</p>

    <p>Now that we have a grayscale value for each pixel we can use it to train our neural network. Now, we create the
        training set containing handdrawn traingles, squares and quadrilaterals.</p>

    <p>Now we can train our neural network. We do this by feeding it the training set and telling it what the correct
        answer is. The neural network will then try to guess what the correct answer is. If it guesses wrong we tell it
        what the correct answer is and it will try again. This process is called backpropagation and it is what makes
        neural networks so powerful.</p>

    <p>After training the neural network we can use it to predict what shape is drawn on the canvas. We do this by
        feeding the neural network the grayscale values of the pixels and it will tell us what it thinks the shape is.
